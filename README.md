# SGP4 C transpiled to Go

An
[SGP4](http://celestrak.com/publications/AIAA/2006-6753/AIAA-2006-6753-Rev2.pdf)
implementation based on
[`github.com/aholinch/sgp4/tree/master/src/c`](https://github.com/aholinch/sgp4/tree/master/src/c),
which ultimated originated with [David Vallado](https://celestrak.com/software/vallado-sw.php).

```
    This file contains the sgp4 procedures for analytical propagation
    of a satellite. the code was originally released in the 1980 and
    1986 spacetrack papers. a detailed discussion of the theory and
    history may be found in the 2006 aiaa paper by vallado, crawford,
    hujsak, and kelso.

This implementation is a hand-edited transpilation of [C
sources](https://github.com/aholinch/sgp4/tree/master/src/c) to Go by
[`c2go`](https://github.com/elliotchance/c2go) (version v0.25.9
Dubnium 2018-12-30), and the emitted code was edited by hand.  The
original C implementation test suite was included in this process.

The substantive edits (of Go sources emitted by the transpiler) were
the use of 64-bit integers to address at least one 32-bit overflow and
using floating point constants instead of naked integer constants when
the entire expression consisted of the latter with some division.
Example: "var x2o3 float64 = 2 / 3" was edited to be "var x2o3 float64
= 2.0 / 3.0".

With those changes, the original (transpiled and hand-edited) tests
almost all pass.  The one exception is for objectNum 20413 at
mins=1844335, where 1e-07 < rdist < 1e-06.  The tests have been edited
to tolerate rdist < 1e-07 rather than demand rdist < 1e-06.

## Usage

The main constructor is `NewTLE()`, and the primary method is
`Prop()`.  See `ExampleProp()` in
[`surface_test.go`](surface_test.go).

See [the documentation](https://godoc.org/github.com/morphism/sgp4go)
for details.

The example command-line program [`sgp4go`](cmd/sgp4go) reads TLEs
from `stdin` and writes propagation data to `stdout`. See
[`test.sh`](test.sh) for an example invocation.
